# The amount of parallel jobs to pick up for the horde. Each running job will consume the amount of RAM needed to run each model, and will also affect the speed of other running jobs
# so make sure you have enough VRAM to load models in parallel, and that the speed of fulfilling requests is not too slow
# Expected limit per VRAM size: <6 VRAM: 1, <=8 VRAM: 2, <=12 VRAM:3, <=14 VRAM: 4
# But remember that the speed of your gens will also be affected for each parallel job

# Please note, that if you *are* getting these messages, you are serving jobs substantially slower than is ideal.
